    <p1>Deadpool is the superhero no one needs, but everyone should love.</br> I love the dark humor associated with deadpool, 
        as well as how he was portrayed in the movies (thank you rated R). </br> Any movie teaser where Ryan Reynolds gets to take out AC Slater is
         my hero. I love you Mr. Pool.</p1>
